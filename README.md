# Calculating-Potential-Customer-Return-with-Rule-Based-Classification-with-Gezinomi-Dataset
This project focuses on exploring potential customer return using the Gezinomi dataset. The dataset includes details of hotel sales in various cities, and our analysis aims to predict customer return under specific seasons or hotel concepts.



<h4>Business Problem:</h4>
Gezginomi aims to create level-based new sales definitions using certain characteristics of its sales and to predict how much new potential customers, segmented according to these definitions, could potentially earn for the company on average.
For example, Gezginomi wants to determine how much on average a customer from Antalya, wishing to stay at an all-inclusive hotel during a peak season, could potentially earn.

<h4>Dataset Story:</h4>
The dataset gezinomi_miuul.xlsx contains prices and details of sales made by Gezginomi company. It consists of records from each sales transaction. This means the table is not singularized. In other words, a customer may have made multiple purchases.

<h4> Variables:  </h4>

* SaleId: Sales ID
* SaleDate: Date of the sale
* Price: Price paid for the sale
* ConceptName: Concept information of the hotel
* SaleCityName: City where the hotel is located
* CheckInDate: Check-in date of the customer at the hotel
* CInDay: Day of the week for customer check-in
